# VidMob Sign Up Page

## Running

Install dependencies with npm i, and then start local server with npm start.

## User Flow

At the default page, to test functionality, type in already used email. This will bring up error message telling you the email is already used. If you enter in a new email, BUT the company already exists, you will be send to the existing company sign up flow. If you enter in a new email and that email is not associated with an existing company, you will be directed to the new company sign up flow. Links have been added to the buttons at the end of each sign up flow and the VidMob logo in order to loop back to the original default view, (for the purpose of this assessment).
